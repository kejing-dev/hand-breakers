[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md) · [Download release APK](https://github.com/kejing-dev/hand-breakers/releases/latest)

A compact, gesture-controlled spatial game for PICO shared space.

![Native gameplay](docs/images/gameplay-detail.png)

## Play

- Grab the paddle and drag horizontally. Releasing pauses; grabbing continues.
- Six automatically advancing levels feature armored bricks, obstacles and collision particles.
- After each complete circuit the paddle cycles through 100% → 67% → 33% → 100% width.
- One compact HUD shows score, level, remaining balls, paddle width, a live hint and mute.
- Grab the paddle after game-over to start a new round.

## Build

Use JDK 21, Android SDK platform 35 and the checked-in Gradle wrapper. The project uses PICO Spatial SDK / SpatialUI **6.1.9**, Kotlin and Noto Sans SC. Do not upgrade the SDK implicitly.

```sh
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest assembleDebug
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat`. Set `ANDROID_HOME` or create an untracked `local.properties` containing `sdk.dir`. Dependencies are fetched from Google, Maven Central and the PICO artifact repository declared in `settings.gradle.kts`.

For a signed release set `ARCADE_KEYSTORE_PATH`, `ARCADE_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `ARCADE_KEY_ALIAS` and `ARCADE_KEY_PASSWORD` in your local environment. Without them Gradle emits an unsigned release APK. Keys and passwords are never part of this repository or its releases.

The published APK is a non-debuggable release build with a dedicated release signing key. Its certificate differs from earlier development APKs. Android cannot overwrite those debug-signed installs with this package; back up any needed data before replacing a development install.

## Project layout

`app/src/main` contains the Kotlin app and this game's runtime assets; `models` contains its editable Blender source. The deterministic simulation library and regression suite are shared with the original four-game prototype, so unused game branches remain in source. This standalone project only builds the named app and does not bundle the other games' models or music library media.

## Verification and limits

See [validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) for build, test, APK and signing evidence. Screenshots show native PICO runtime captures from the accepted development baseline; they are not mockups and do not prove physical hand input. Real hand tracking, subjective sound, binocular comfort and sustained device performance still require device testing.

## Assets and third-party dependencies

Original game models are included as GLB/Blender files. Noto Sans SC is covered by the [SIL Open Font License](licenses/NotoSansSC-OFL.txt). PICO Spatial SDK and Android dependencies retain their respective licenses. No signing keys, device identifiers or private conversation transcripts are included.
